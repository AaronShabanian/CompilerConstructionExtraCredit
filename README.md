# Andrea Armani Talk
I enjoyed listening to Andrea Armani's talk today and learned a lot about her life and research. <br> <br>
## Education history
First, she went over her education background of impressive universities going from UPenn to Caltech and worked under impressive professors in the difficult field of physics. She also went over the importance of playing a sport and going outside even while studying a lot. 
I was interested in her emphasis on time management throughout her college career and feel myself having the same problems during my undergrad career. 
## Research Today
Currently she is working on TPE research which is apart of Nonlinear optical imaging agents. She went over the potentials of her research and showed that TPE can be used to help fight breast cancel. By attaching TPE to HER2, they can observe the differences. 
### Devices
I found it interesting how she works on devices that are advancing science. She went over her research and development of Optical resonators which filter optical signals. It was also interesting to learn about bottom-up fabrication and how it was used in her research  She also worked on a device of Stretchable, healable optics and tried many different patterns aswell. 
### Post talk questions
I was curious as to why she decided to go to grad school and she went over how she didn't really decide until the last minute. I feel that same way as I am still debating what I am going to do once I graduate and could understand her struggle in deciding. 
## Conclusion
While most of what she was descibing was foreign to me as I don't have a strong Post-grad knowledge base in Physics, Chemistry or Biology like she did, I still found it interesting to learn about the research that she was doing every day and the possibilites of what a future career could look like if I continued my education by going the grad school route.
